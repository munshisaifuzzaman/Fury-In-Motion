## üöÄ Project Overview

**Fury In Motion** is an interactive scientific visualization platform that explores U.S. tornado data through dynamic maps, statistical analysis, and weather integration.  
We aim to help users:

- Analyze historical tornado events (1950‚Äì2023).
- Explore how tornado severity correlates with environmental and demographic factors.
- Investigate patterns in tornado behavior over time.

This project was developed as part of a scientific visualization course.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **General Goals:**
  - Display tornado data in an engaging and informative format.
  - Use multiple forms of visualization to communicate complex patterns effectively.
  - Cover a large time span to uncover long-term trends.

- **Scientific Goals:**
  - **Munshi:** Visualize and compare the top 10‚Äì50 most impactful tornadoes based on path length, width, fatalities, and injuries, integrating historical weather conditions.
  - **Sam:** Incorporate NOAA weather station data to explore meteorological influences on tornado frequency and distribution.
  - **Matthew:** Investigate the relationship between county population sizes and tornado damage (fatalities and injuries).

---

## üìö Background

- **Primary Dataset:**  
  NOAA's US Tornado Database (1950‚Äì2023).

- **Supplementary Data:**
  - NOAA Weather Stations (precipitation, temperature, etc.).
  - Open-Meteo Weather API (historical hourly/daily weather).
  - U.S. Census Bureau County Population Estimates (2023).
  - TIGER Line Shapefiles for county boundaries.

- **Scientific Context:**  
  We consulted academic and meteorological resources to hypothesize and validate relationships between atmospheric conditions and tornado severity.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Components

- **Top-N Tornado Explorer:**  
  Visualizes the most impactful tornadoes colored by EF rating, with weather-enriched start/end popups.

- **Scientific Question Explorer:**  
  Explores relationships between tornado metrics and weather variables (e.g., temperature vs. path length, wind speed vs. fatalities).

- **Meteorological Trends Over Time:**  
  Investigates how tornado frequency and intensity vary across seasons and decades using weather station data.

- **Demographic Impact Map:**  
  Interactive choropleth showing county populations overlaid with tornado damage indicators.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **Framework:** Python + Streamlit
- **Main Libraries:**
  - Folium (Geospatial maps)
  - Plotly (Interactive plots and radar charts)
  - GeoPandas (Geographical data processing)
  - PyDeck (Stacked geo bar charts)
  - TQDM, Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy, Shapely

- **Architecture:**

```bash
/data                # Tornado datasets, GeoJSONs
/cache               # Prefetched weather data (weather_cache.json)
/utils               # Data loading and processing utilities
/components          # Visualization modules
/science_questions   # Scientific exploration scripts
app.py               # Main Streamlit app
```
- - **Caching Strategy:**  
  Used local caching of weather API responses to ensure faster rendering and reproducibility.

---

## üìà Scientific Highlights

- Most severe tornadoes (by fatalities and width) cluster heavily in the Southeast and Midwest.
- Higher surface temperatures did **not** strongly correlate with longer tornado paths.
- Surface wind gusts showed **weak** correlation with fatalities.
- Precipitation levels had **minimal** correlation with tornado width.

These results challenge common assumptions and highlight the complex, multifactorial nature of tornado impacts.

---

## üß† Key Learnings

- Data-driven validation is essential‚Äîhypotheses often fail under empirical scrutiny.
- API-based data enrichment introduces reproducibility and scaling challenges.
- Balancing interactivity and clarity in visualizations is critical to avoid overwhelming users.
- Visual analytics such as correlation matrices and radar charts can reveal or debunk assumed patterns.
