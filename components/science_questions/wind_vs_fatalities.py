        #### 🔬 Scientific Question: Do Higher Surface Wind Gusts Correlate with More Fatalities?

        **Goal:**  
        To explore whether tornadoes occurring on days with stronger surface wind gusts tend to result in more fatalities.

        **Initial Hypothesis:**  
        Tornadoes that form under conditions of stronger surface winds (e.g., gust fronts, downdrafts) are more likely to cause structural damage and increase fatality risk.

        **Datasets Used:**
        - **Fatalities**: Provided in the NOAA SPC tornado dataset.
        - **Max Wind Speed at 10m (`wind_speed_10m_max`)**: Daily surface wind gust (km/h) retrieved from Open-Meteo’s historical weather API at the tornado’s start location.

        **Weather Variable Explained:**  
        - `wind_speed_10m_max` refers to the **maximum surface wind speed (gust)** recorded at **10 meters above ground** on the day of the tornado.  
        - This metric reflects the **storm environment** rather than the tornado’s internal wind.

        **Visualization Strategy:**
        - Plot wind gusts against the number of fatalities using a **scatter plot**.
        - Group tornadoes by EF rating or fatality count buckets to compare **wind gust patterns** using a **box plot** or **density chart**.

        **What We Hope to Learn:**
        - Are tornadoes with higher fatality counts associated with stronger wind gusts?
        - Does wind gust appear to be a proxy for severity or casualty potential?

        **Next Steps:**
        After confirming the data availability and quality, we’ll move on to plotting and interpreting the results to confirm or refute the hypothesis.

    # 📌 Interpretation
    st.markdown("""
    ### 🧠 Interpretation

    - The scatter plot reveals whether a positive correlation exists between surface wind and fatalities.
    - The box plot helps determine if tornadoes with higher fatalities tend to occur on higher-wind days.
    - If **higher fatality bins consistently show higher wind speeds**, it may suggest environmental wind shear or gust potential plays a role in impact severity.

    ### ✅ Result

    _[⬜ To be filled based on output — e.g., “Moderate wind values (30–40 km/h) were common across all fatality groups, with no strong upward trend observed.”]_  
    _[⬜ Or “The 21+ fatality bin had a significantly higher wind gust distribution compared to 0-death tornadoes.”]_
