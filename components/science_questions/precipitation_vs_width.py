        #### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Question: Does Precipitation Correlate with Tornado Width?

        **Goal:**  
        To explore whether tornadoes that occur on days with higher precipitation totals tend to have wider paths, suggesting a possible link between moisture content and tornado scale.

        **Initial Hypothesis:**  
        Increased precipitation reflects deeper convective processes, which may contribute to broader tornado formation and path spread.

        **Datasets Used:**
        - **Tornado Width (`wid`)**: Measured in yards, from NOAA SPC dataset.
        - **Precipitation Sum (`precipitation_sum`)**: Daily total precipitation from Open-Meteo historical API.

        **Weather Variable Explained:**  
        - `precipitation_sum` measures the total rainfall (in mm) recorded on the day and at the location of the tornado's origin.

        **Visualization Strategy:**
        - Use a **scatter plot** with regression to analyze correlation.
        - Group tornadoes by width buckets and compare average precipitation using a **box plot**.

        **What We Hope to Learn:**
        - Do wider tornadoes occur on rainier days?
        - Can precipitation act as a predictor of large tornado path widths?

        #### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Question: Do Heavier Rainfall Events Lead to Wider Tornadoes?

        **Goal:**  
        To investigate whether tornadoes associated with higher daily precipitation levels tend to be wider in size.

        **Initial Hypothesis:**  
        Tornadoes forming during heavy precipitation events (e.g., supercells or mesoscale systems) might exhibit wider structures due to enhanced moisture, storm dynamics, or embedded storm mergers.

        **Datasets Used:**
        - **Tornado Width**: Provided in the NOAA SPC tornado dataset (in yards).
        - **Precipitation (`precipitation_sum`)**: Daily precipitation (in mm) retrieved via Open-Meteoâ€™s API based on the tornadoâ€™s start coordinates.

        **Weather Variable Explained:**  
        - `precipitation_sum` reflects the **total daily rainfall** at the tornado's location.  
        - It helps indicate whether the tornado was part of a **wet thunderstorm system** or occurred during drier atmospheric conditions.

        **Visualization Strategy:**
        - We use a **scatter plot** to examine trends between tornado width and precipitation.
        - We also use a **box plot** grouped by width categories to study variability across different tornado size ranges.

        ### ðŸ“Š What We Observed from Top 50 Tornadoes

        **1. Top 50 by Width**
        - Scatter plot shows wide tornadoes occurring across both light and moderate rainfall.
        - Box plot reveals **no significant increase in precipitation for wider tornadoes**.
        - âž¤ **Conclusion:** Width alone is not a predictor of rainfall intensity.

        **2. Top 50 by Length**
        - Slight upward trend in precipitation vs. width, though not very strong.
        - Box plot shows a **consistent rainfall pattern across different width groups**.
        - âž¤ **Conclusion:** Long-path tornadoes may intersect more precipitation, but no solid trend found.

        **3. Top 50 by Fatalities**
        - Scatter plot includes a few **extreme precipitation outliers (>120mm)**.
        - A **downward trend** observed: more fatal tornadoes often occur with **lower or moderate rainfall**.
        - âž¤ **Conclusion:** Human impact is not tied to rainfall levels. Precipitation does **not predict fatalities**.

        ---

        ### ðŸ§  Interpretation
        - Precipitation **does not strongly correlate** with tornado width across any filtered group.
        - **Rainfall may be a byproduct** of the storm type, but not a controlling factor for tornado size.
        - Larger or fatal tornadoes are often driven by **other dynamics** such as CAPE, shear, or terrainâ€”not rainfall.

        ### âœ… Summary
        The evidence suggests **no strong correlation** between daily precipitation and tornado width.  
        Future analysis could explore **multi-variable relationships** (e.g., CAPE + precipitation + EF) to uncover deeper insights.
